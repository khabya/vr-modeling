# C#/Unity Reference

This is aimed at people wanting to view or edit the Unity related code.

The `Scripts` folder includes all C# code. 
However, a lot of functionality (or parametrization) is also inside the scene and prefabs(!)

Generated/unimportant folders:
- `Main`, lighting data
- `Plugins`, dlls
- `Settings`
- `Materials/TextMesh Pro`
