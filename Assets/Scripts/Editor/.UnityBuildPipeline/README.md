To use this build pipeline you must have the Odin Inspector paid asset.
If you do you can remove the dot from the folder name to stop unity from ignoring this folder.
See https://github.com/rogerbarton/UnityBuildPipeline for more details.

The pipeline is configured to run CMake in release mode before building.
