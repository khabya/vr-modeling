UnityNativeTool - Stub UnityInterfaces
======================================

A one file library that gets us the pointer to the UnityInterfaces
This is used by the UnityNativeTool to call :cpp:func:`UnityPluginLoad` and
:cpp:func:`UnityPluginUnload` for our mocked libraries. This library is not mocked.
