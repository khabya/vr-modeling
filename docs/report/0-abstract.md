# Abstract

3D modeling on a 2D monitor lacks the true representation of depth and scale that virtual reality can provide. This report explores the use of 3D modeling deformations, provided by libigl, in virtual reality. The project is heavily implementation focused. It thus elaborates on the particular difficulties and technicalities, both in the frontend and backend, involved in creating an expansible virtual reality mesh editor in the Unity game engine. Cross-platform controller input is used in combination with world space user interface to drive geometry calculations. Tooltips and further user interface hints are added to improve user-friendliness. Threading is considered to maintain a responsive virtual reality experience. Implementing this with the libigl library and Unity game engine requires a necessary C\#/C++ language interface. Possibilities for continuing this project are discussed and the need for 2D and virtual reality editors to work together.
