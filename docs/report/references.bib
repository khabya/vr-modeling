abstract = {Modeling tasks, such as surface deformation and editing, can be analyzed by observing the local behavior of the surface. We argue that defining a modeling operation by asking for rigidity of the local transformations is useful in various settings. Such formulation leads to a non-linear, yet conceptually simple energy formulation, which is to be minimized by the deformed surface under particular modeling constraints. We devise a simple iterative mesh editing scheme based on this principle, that leads to detail-preserving and intuitive deformations. Our algorithm is effective and notably easy to implement, making it attractive for practical modeling applications.},

  abstract = {Surface editing operations commonly require geometric details of the surface to be preserved as much as possible. We argue that geometric detail is an intrinsic property of a surface and that, consequently, surface editing is best performed by operating over an intrinsic surface representation. We provide such a representation of a surface, based on the Laplacian of the mesh, by encoding each vertex relative to its neighborhood. The Laplacian of the mesh is enhanced to be invariant to locally linearized rigid transformations and scaling. Based on this Laplacian representation, we develop useful editing operations: interactive free-form deformation in a region of interest based on the transformation of a handle, transfer and mixing of geometric details between two surfaces, and transplanting of a partial surface mesh onto another surface. The main computation involved in all operations is the solution of a sparse linear system, which can be done at interactive rates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in several examples, showing that the editing operations change the shape while respecting the structural geometric detail.},
